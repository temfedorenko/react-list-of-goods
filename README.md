# Tasks from MATE.Academy

1. At first show a button with text Start on the page
2. Clicking the button shows a GoodsList (ul > li) with the given goods and hides the Start button
3. Add button with text Reverse to show the goods in reversed order
4. Add button with text Sort alphabetically to show the goods in alphabetical order
5. Add button with text Reset to show the goods in the initial order
6. Add button with text Sort by length to show the goods ordered by name length

## (*) Advanced tasks (require understanding of Forms in React)
1. Add <select> with numbers from 1 to 10. (1 is default). All the previous buttons should now show only goods having length >= than the selected value. 
When you change the value the items should be immediately re-rendered accordingly.
2. Reset button should set the default value to the <select>.
3. Add some styles, you are frontend developer :) (use Bulma or another library)
